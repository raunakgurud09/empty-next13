## **What is Bun?**

Bun is a new runtime that provides an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called Bun, making your app run really fast.

## **How Does Bun Do It?**

Unlike other runtimes, such as Node or Deno, which use the heavy and slow Chromium V8 engine developed by Google, Bun uses a different engine called JavaScriptCore, developed by Apple. This engine is written in Zig, which makes Bun a fast runtime.

# **What does bun do**

Bun takes care of developer experience and performance through its feature

## **Features that will be useful.**

### **Developer experience**

Bun is committed to providing an unparalleled developer experience. We pride ourselves on offering intuitive and easy-to-use APIs that help streamline the development process. In addition to our existing APIs.

Let's try building an API server in Bun.

```bash
    # install bun
    # https://bun.sh/docs/installation
```

```bash
    # check bun is working
    bun -h
```

```bash
    mkdir bun
    cd bun
```

```bash
    bun init
```

write on index.ts file

no need to install nodemon ts-node and other development packages it just works

### **Import require**

The transition from CommonJS to ES modules has been slow and full of terrors. After ESM was introduced, Node.js took 5 years before supporting it without an `--experimental-modules` flag. Regardless, the ecosystem is still full of CommonJS.

Bun supports both module systems, all the time. No need to worry about file extensions, `.js` vs `.cjs` vs `.mjs`, or including `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.

You can even use `import` and `require()`, *in the same file.* It just works.

```jsx
    import lodash from "lodash";
    const _ = require("underscore");
```

### **Quick setup**

Whenever I begin working on a new project, I need to install `nodemon`, set up `tsconfig`, `jest`, `"webpack"`, and many other dependencies. But you don't have to worry about that anymore!

Just type the following:

```bash
    bun init
```

It works like magic

**Bundlers**

**Testing libraries**

**Transpilers**

`nodemon` — Bun has a built-in watch mode!

`dotenv`, `cross-env` — Bun reads `.env` files by default

### **It is fast**

Bun is a fast framework, starting up to 4x [**faster**](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1499225725492076544) than Node.js. This speed difference is even more pronounced when running a TypeScript file, which needs to be transpired before it can be run by Node.js.

![fast-1](/images/blog/bun/fast-1.avif)

Bun is orders of magnitude faster than `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`. It uses a global module cache to avoid redundant downloads from the npm registry and uses the fastest system calls available on each operating system.

# **Problems**

I am currently unable to come up with any problems.

## **Will bun will be replaced**

In my opinion, it's not a matter of **will** but rather **when** to start using Bun. Even if it may not be as performant as they tested, I would use Bun for the developer experience itself. It can save a lot of time for setup and ensuring everything works properly.
